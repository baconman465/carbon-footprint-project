                One of the best ways to reduce your carbon footprint is to drive less. There are several alternative to driving,
                including taking public transportation (if available where you live) and riding a bike.<br>
                In a perfect world, you would be able to stop driving entirely, which would save about
                2.6 tons of carbon dioxode, according to 2017 study from researchers at Lund University
                and the University of British Columbia. However, this is unrealistic. <br>

                There are several ways to reduce carbon emissions even when driving. These include carpooling, checking your tires and
                leaving unneccesary items behind to reduce weight.

                Another great way to reduce you carbon footprint, if you have the money, is to get a more environment friendly car.
                This also depends on where you live, as there might be less availablity for electic or hybrid cars.
