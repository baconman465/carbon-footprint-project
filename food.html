                One of the best ways to reduce your carbon foorprint via your diet is to stop eating meat, particulaly red meat.
                Cows give off methane emissions, and producing red meat requires land, water and feed.

                Around 40 percent of food Americans buy is completely wasted. However, this is very easy to avoid.
                Some things you could do include planning your meals so they're not too much, not buying in bulk, 
                freezing food to extend its lifespan and eating leftovers instead of throwing them away. 
                There are also many other things you could do besides the things on this list.
